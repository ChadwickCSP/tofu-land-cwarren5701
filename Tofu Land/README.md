## Final Solution
![Video Preview](Tofu_World.mov)

## Known Bugs
When the Tofu collects multiple orbs to increase speed, sometimes the Tofu is able to get through some of the box and edge colliders. In addition, when I run my game, some of the tiles still look different and it apears there's a little bit of space between the tiles.

## Testing Methods 
I tested my solution but running the game numerous times to make sure the code works and there are no issues.
